# Understanding-Basics-of-OpenCV

**What is OpenCV?**
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a free and open-source library that helps computers understand and process images and videos. It provides tools and functions to perform tasks like reading images, detecting faces, recognizing objects, and even working with live camera feeds.

I have added the files relating to basics of OpenCV required to understand for coding purpose at more advance level. There are different topics like creating a line on the imgae, Flipping, Rotation, Cropping the image, Creating various shapes like rectangle, Square, Circle etc.

**With OpenCV, you can do things like:**
1. Convert images to black and white
   
2. Blur or sharpen images
   
3. Detect edges, shapes, or colors
   
4. Track movement in videos
   
5. Build real-time applications using your webcam

Itâ€™s widely used in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and works well with Python, making it a great choice for beginners and other professionals too.
